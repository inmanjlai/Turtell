<h2 align="center"> Brief Overview </h2>
<br/>
Turtell is a Reddit Clone built under two weeks. It allows you to create and join different communities, post in those communities for all members to view and comment on those posts to increase interaction between users. You can also search for communities using the searchbar built into the navbar that autocompletes search. I decided to not copy the styling of Reddit and work with my own design instead and was pretty satisfied with what I came up with. The goal was a simple minimalistic design that still showed off a good understanding of CSS and design fundamentals.
